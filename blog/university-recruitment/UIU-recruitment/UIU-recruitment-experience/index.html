        <p>Hello, I am Charles Aunkan Gomes, Lecturer of the CSE department at United International University. I am
            sharing my observations and experience of the interview process for a lecturer position in this university.
            Please take these points as suggestions rather than strict guidelines.</p>

        <h2>Interview Process</h2>
        <p>During the interview process, there are three steps: CV Screening, Demo Class, and Final Viva.</p>

        <h2>1. CV Screening</h2>
        <p><strong>Process:</strong> This portion literally depends on how many candidates apply from each university.
            It varies; normally, top students from every university easily meet the cutoff. In this recruitment, only 66
            candidates have been selected from 1000+ applicants. So those who are reading this, consider yourself as a
            topper.</p>
        <p><strong>Suggestions:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Prepare an academic CV.</li>
            <li>Make sure to include the latest CGPA.</li>
            <li>Add all academic papers, thesis.</li>
            <li>Add extra-curricular activities such as Math Olympiad, CTF.</li>
            <li>Add teaching experience in your CV.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Demo Class</h2>
        <p><strong>Process:</strong> In this part, a demo topic will be given, and about 1-2 minutes will be given for
            preparation. Normally, pretty basic concepts are asked for presentation in the demo. Then you give your
            presentation for 2-4 minutes. Afterward, a few questions will be asked.</p>
        <p><strong>Topics:</strong> Prepare all basic topics of SPL, OOP (C++ and Java), and DSA. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Conditional Statements, Switch case, Loop, Nested Loop, Structure, Union, Pointer, Recursion,
                User-defined function, etc.</li>
            <li>Class, Object, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Constructor, Destructor, Method
                overloading, and overriding, etc.</li>
            <li>Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Graph, Tree, Searching, and sorting algorithms, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Suggestions:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The entire presentation must be given in English.</li>
            <li>Maintain a good flow while explaining.</li>
            <li>Maintain eye contact with the examiner.</li>
            <li>Your voice should be loud and clear enough.</li>
            <li>Write on the board for visual representation.</li>
            <li>Maintain proper dress code.</li>
            <li>Show eagerness and engagement with the examiner.</li>
            <li>Wipe the board while you leave the room after the demo.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Final Viva</h2>
        <p><strong>Process:</strong> Final interview is arranged on a separate day from the demo. If you are called for
            the final interview, you will be facing a panel consisting of 6-7 professors of UIU, VC sir, and an external
            professor from BUET. At the very beginning, the VC sir will ask your latest CGPA and department position.
            Then, you will be asked for your three favorite courses. Mention three courses that you feel confident
            enough about. Then different professors will ask you questions from different topics. Normally, simple
            questions are asked at first and gradually dive into the depth of that topic. Answer confidently and with a
            clear voice. If you don’t know the answer to any question, gently say you don’t know the answer. Don’t try
            to assume or complicate any answer.</p>
        <p><strong>My Experience:</strong> I told SPL, OOP, and DSA as my favorite courses. Hence, I was asked these
            questions (I may have forgotten some).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Where is the “friend” keyword used?</li>
            <li>What is a friend function? Describe its scope.</li>
            <li>What is private, protected, and public? Describe their scopes.</li>
            <li>Describe the greedy algorithm.</li>
            <li>Why do we use the DP approach?</li>
            <li>What benefit does DP have over the greedy approach?</li>
            <li>Iteration vs Recursion? Which one is the best?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I answered all the questions properly. These are pretty basic concepts. I am including a few more questions
            asked to other candidates:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Is multiple inheritance supported in Java?</li>
            <li>Describe the diamond problem?</li>
            <li>Describe the best case scenario of an array list?</li>
            <li>How can you reach the middle of a linked list without counting the number of nodes?</li>
            <li>Time complexity analysis of different algorithms.</li>
            <li>Types of binary tree and many more.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Think of this like the central viva you faced in KUET. Try to acknowledge what questions are generally asked
            during the interview. My serial in the interview process was in the middle. So, I got a chance to hear out
            questions asked to other candidates. Thesis-related questions are not asked that often. But keep a proper
            idea about your thesis, and it’s better to bring your thesis book in case anyone wants to see it. Bring all
            academic documents with you. Maintain a proper dress code.</p>

        </ul>

        <h2>Pros</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The salary offered at UIU is notably higher compared to other universities.</li>
            <li>Payments are consistently made before the month-end and are punctual.</li>
            <li>Study leaves are provided, and during PhD/MSc programs, payments accrue and are disbursed upon return.
            </li>
            <li>UIU offers comfortable housing options for faculty and administration at reasonable rates within its
                complex. (With Family parents or wife)</li>
            <li>Research facilities are excellent, with ample funding available through IIR.</li>
            <li>The atmosphere among colleagues, students, and teaching assistants/undergraduate assistants is good and
                collaborative.</li>
            <li>UIU provides three short-term breaks throughout the year, as well as Eid bonuses and generous vacation
                time.</li>
            <li>With a four-day workweek and relatively lower workload compared to industry standards, there's a healthy
                work-life balance.</li>
            <li>The teaching system offers flexibility.</li>
            <li>Increments are contingent upon research paper publications and are reviewed yearly.</li>
            <li>Lecturer rooms are well-equipped, and amenities such as table tennis, games, and tea facilities are
                available in the teacher lounge, enhancing the overall working environment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cons</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>In and out time of classes are strictly monitored.</li>
            <li>Consistent rule-breaking may result in warnings and, in extreme cases, demotion to part-time status.
            </li>
            <li>Course preferences are often allocated based on seniority, meaning newer faculty members may end up
                teaching less desirable courses sometimes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>All About Salary</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Basic: 2 Theory, 2 Lab - 78,000 BDT (4 courses)</li>
            <li>Overload in Trimester: Theory - 3 Credits - 57,750 BDT (Per trimester)</li>
            <li>Overload in Trimester: Lab - 1 Credit - 0.7 * 57,750 BDT (Per trimester)</li>
            <li>Normally, each faculty has to take a minimum of 2 course overloads per Trimester.</li>
            <li>So the salary reaches to 110,000 - 120,000 BDT per month.</li>
            <li>Increment per year: 4,000/5,000 BDT approximately.</li>
        </ul>
